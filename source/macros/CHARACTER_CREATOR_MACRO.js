/**
 * SWADE Fantasy World Kit - Character Manager Macro
 *
 * Opens Character Manager for the selected token's actor (or the user's assigned
 * character), to build out ancestry/skills/edges/hindrances/gear or track advancement.
 * Copy this entire script into a Foundry macro for quick access.
 * Usage: Create a new "Script" macro and paste this code into it.
 *
 * Character Manager only edits an existing actor — it does not create new characters.
 * Select a token or assign a character to your user before running this macro.
 *
 * Quick hotbar button: Click to manage character
