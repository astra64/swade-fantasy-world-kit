# SWADE Fantasy World Kit - Development and Roadmap

This file tracks current architecture, implemented behavior, release readiness checks, and near-term roadmap.

---

## Current Architecture

### Module Entry and Wiring

- `scripts/main.js`
  - Runtime orchestrator only.
  - Registers hooks (`init`, `ready`, sidebar/compendium renders).
  - Wires factories and exposes required APIs on `window` for app class interop.

### Libraries and Factories

- `scripts/lib/preset-utils.js`
  - Preset parsing and state API (`createPresetApi`).
- `scripts/lib/dependencies.js`
  - Dependency graph traversal and resolution (`createDependencyApi`).
- `scripts/settings.js`
  - Settings and menu registration (`setupSettings`).
- `scripts/migrations.js`
  - Legacy setting migration and sanitizers (`setupMigrations`).
- `scripts/ui.js`
  - Compendium styling/filtering, quick access injection, pack permission patching, Quick Insert sync (`setupUI`).

### Applications and UI

- `scripts/apps/BaselineModulesManager.js`
  - Preset Modules manager FormApplication.
  - Save to preset, apply preset, manage presets, dependency prompts.
- `scripts/apps/ExtraVisiblePacksSelector.js`
  - Searchable pack visibility selector FormApplication.
- `templates/baseline-modules.hbs`
  - Preset Modules manager template.
- `templates/pack-selector.hbs`
  - Pack selector template.
- `styles/module.css`
  - Visual styling for manager UIs and compendium row theming.

## Current Behavior

### Preset Modules Manager

- Named presets are supported (create, rename, duplicate, delete).
- Editing flow is explicit:
  1. Choose preset.
  2. Adjust checked modules.
  3. Save to preset.
  4. Apply preset to world.
- Apply is authoritative:
  - Enables installed modules in the selected preset (plus required deps and approved dependency adds).
  - Disables active modules not in the selected preset (except this module itself).
  - Skips uninstalled modules.
  - Reloads world when activation changes are made.
- Applied preset ID is tracked separately from active editing preset ID.

### Curated Compendium Visibility

- Curated mode filters player-visible compendium packs.
- GM can bypass filtering via setting.
- Extra visible packs can be allowlisted via selector.
- Sidebar styling/filtering is re-applied on relevant render hooks.

### Integrations

- Quick Insert restrictions sync to curated visibility rules.
- Player pack access is patched to respect curated filtering.
- GM quick access button in Settings sidebar is supported.
- Keyboard shortcut to open Preset Modules manager is supported (`Ctrl+Shift+B`, GM only).

### Compatibility

- Legacy settings migration from `swade-consolidated-fantasy-compendiums` is still present.
- Migration cleanup is deferred to a dedicated cleanup release.

## Settings Inventory

### World Scope

- `curatedMode`
- `gmSeesAllPacks`
- `extraVisiblePacks`
- `baselineModules` (legacy/advanced compatibility)
- `baselineModuleTitles`
- `activeBaselinePresetId`
- `appliedBaselinePresetId`
- `legacyWorldSettingsMigrated`

### Client Scope

- `globalBaselineModules` (legacy/advanced compatibility)
- `globalBaselineModuleTitles` (legacy/advanced compatibility)
- `namedBaselinePresets`
- `legacyClientSettingsMigrated`
- `gmQuickAccessSidebarButton`

## Validation Checklist

Run this after significant code changes and before release.

1. Module loads in Foundry v13 with no init/ready errors.
2. Preset manager opens from settings menu and `Ctrl+Shift+B`.
3. Save to Preset persists changes to the selected preset.
4. Apply Preset to World:
   - enables modules in preset,
   - disables active modules not in preset,
   - prompts for missing installed dependencies,
   - skips uninstalled modules,
   - reloads world when needed.
5. Preset manager reopens after reload when apply triggered reload.
6. Curated compendium filtering works for players and GM override behaves correctly.
7. Quick Insert restrictions sync correctly when curated visibility changes.
8. Extra visible packs selector saves and updates visibility.

## Roadmap

### Near Term (v0.4.x)

- Improve apply summary UX with clearer per-action details (enabled/disabled/skipped/dependency-added names).
- Add optional dry-run preview before apply (show expected enable/disable diff).
- Add focused regression tests/check scripts for preset apply behavior.

### Mid Term (v0.5.x)

- Preset portability:
  - export/import named presets with schema versioning,
  - conflict handling for missing modules.
- Optional "module settings carryover" tools for selected third-party modules.
- Continue reducing orchestrator complexity in `scripts/main.js` where practical.

### Cleanup Release (post-legacy window)

- Remove legacy migration function and flags.
- Remove legacy constants and old setting compatibility scaffolding.

### Future (v0.6.x+)

- Actor/item migration helpers for replacing records with module compendium versions.
- Optional import-compatibility image remapper fallback.

## Notes for Contributors

- Prefer small, behavior-preserving edits.
- Keep public settings keys stable unless migration is included.
- Treat preset apply behavior as a core contract: preset is authoritative.
- Validate in Foundry after refactors even when static diagnostics are clean.
